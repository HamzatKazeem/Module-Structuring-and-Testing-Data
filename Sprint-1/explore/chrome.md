Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?  
console: alert('Hello World')
Answer: Displays a dialog box bearing Hello World.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have? 
console: myName = prompt('What is your name')
Answer: Display an input text box with a label What is your name

What is the return value of `prompt`? 
Answer: The value provided to the input box. In my own case, my first name, Kazeem
